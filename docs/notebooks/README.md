JupyterLab Notebooks
====================

Use this directory for notebooks that demonstrate `matrixlayout` features.

Guidelines
----------
- Keep notebooks short and focused.
- Include a brief header cell describing the goal.
- Avoid large binary outputs in version control.

Notebooks are referenced from MkDocs via `mkdocs-jupyter`.

Notebook outputs should be cleared before committing unless the output is
essential for documentation.
